"When the thermostat is incorrectly set too high, does the room temperature usually rise above comfort levels?",Yes,Observational,HVAC
Is there a historical association between blocked vents and overheating in the building logs?,Yes,Observational,HVAC
"If we manually set the thermostat to 22°C (do(set_temp=22)), will the overheating likely reduce?",Yes,Interventional,HVAC
"If all vents are forced open (do(vents=open)), will airflow improve and reduce overheating?",Yes,Interventional,HVAC
"The room overheated because the thermostat was set at 30°C. If the thermostat had been set correctly at 22°C, would the room still have overheated?",No,Counterfactual,HVAC
"The HVAC system malfunctioned and caused overheating. If the malfunction had not occurred, would the temperature have remained normal?",Yes,Counterfactual,HVAC
"The vents were blocked and overheating happened. If the vents had not been blocked, would the overheating still likely occur?",No,Counterfactual,HVAC
Does the security alarm often activate when the hallway motion sensor detects sudden spikes at night?,Yes,Observational,Security
Is there a correlation between strong Wi-Fi interference and false sensor activations?,Yes,Observational,Security
"If we disable the hallway sensor temporarily (do(sensor=off)), will the alarm stop triggering?",Yes,Interventional,Security
"If we reduce sensor sensitivity manually (do(sensitivity=low)), will the false alarms likely decrease?",Yes,Interventional,Security
"The alarm went off because the sensor malfunctioned. If the sensor had not malfunctioned, would the alarm still have triggered?",No,Counterfactual,Security
"A false alarm occurred due to strong electromagnetic interference. If no interference had been present, would the alarm have triggered?",No,Counterfactual,Security
"A false alarm happened after a power fluctuation. If the power had remained stable, would the alarm still have gone off?",No,Counterfactual,Security
"When occupancy is mis-detected as zero, do lights often turn off unexpectedly?",Yes,Observational,Lighting
Is incorrect occupancy detection frequently associated with rapid lighting toggles?,Yes,Observational,Lighting
"If we force the occupancy sensor to 'occupied' (do(occupancy=1)), will the lights remain ON regardless of detection errors?",Yes,Interventional,Lighting
"If we manually override the lights to ON (do(light=on)), will the anomaly of lights flickering stop?",Yes,Interventional,Lighting
"Lights turned OFF because the system mis-detected zero occupancy. If the system had detected occupancy correctly, would the lights have stayed ON?",Yes,Counterfactual,Lighting
"The lights flickered because the occupancy sensor sent conflicting readings. If the sensor had not malfunctioned, would the lights still flicker?",No,Counterfactual,Lighting
